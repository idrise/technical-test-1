## Things to fix

Test Coverage Incomplete

Types are not yet shared between front and backend

There are several types missing

Used material-ui as compromise for speed

Inline styles used, would normally seperate into CSS

Jest configuration is throwing warnings

Linting and Prettier is configured only for VSCode

Warning displayed in dist folder, should be ignored

Missing current score on question pages

In a real application I would be storing each answer in the API to gather metrics and store progress.
